# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **The health route now returns status-only by default.**
  `GET /api/scolta/v1/health` previously exposed the full diagnostic payload
  (AI provider, configured flags, index state, scoring config) to every
  caller. Monitoring endpoints keep working: the route still answers HTTP 200
  with `{"status": "ok"|"degraded"}`, computed from the full report so
  degradation stays visible. The detail moved behind the new `healthDetail`
  module option (default `false`); there is no user model in a headless
  stack, so detail is config-gated rather than auth-gated. Matches the
  status-only anonymous shape of the PHP-family and Django adapters.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-09

- The `scolta` dependency now uses the published `^1.0.0` range instead of a
  local `file:../scolta-node` path, so the released tarball installs the binding
  from npm.

- Nitro AI routes now send the raw payload (`{terms}` / `{summary}` /
  `{response}`) on success and `{error}` on failure, instead of an `{ok,data}`
  envelope — matching what `scolta.js` reads and the Django/Laravel/Drupal
  controllers emit. (Previously the widget received the data nested under
  `data`, so AI overviews and expansion chips never rendered.)
- Default the AI service to the auto-provisioning `AmazeeAiService` when the
  resolved provider is `amazee` (free LiteLLM trial, no key required), backed by
  a filesystem credential store under the state dir.
- `fromEnv` now lets `SCOLTA_AI_PROVIDER` / `SCOLTA_API_KEY` / `SCOLTA_AI_MODEL`
  / `SCOLTA_AI_BASE_URL` override the static config, so a deployment can point AI
  at an explicit provider/key and bypass the Amazee default.
- Initial Nuxt 3 module: Nitro AI server routes, `<ScoltaSearch>` Vue component,
  static-output crawl + content-source modes, the `scolta-build` CLI, and asset
  vendoring. Reuses the `scolta` binding for all indexing/scoring/AI; no bundled
  CMS module.
